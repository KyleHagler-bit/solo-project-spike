# Quick Journal Project Spike
The purpose of this project is to take the assumed hardest part of the project (i.e. spike) and see if it can be done in a timely manner.

Ths spike focuses on using charts inside React Redux in order to display information in a helpful way.

Chart.js was used for this spike and two graphs (Pie and Line) were made to use in the final project.
